# Handwritten Digit Pairs Classification by Machine Learning

This is for ECE4200/5420-Fundamentals of Machine Learning final Mini-Project (Cornell University SP24)

## Overview

This MiniProject submission folder contains 5 machine learning implementation - Naive Bayes, Softmax Regression, Kernel SVM, Pure-CNN, CNN-ResNet. All of them can be found in the corresponding folder, and all the code were written in the jupyter notebooks.

The dataset ***data.npz.zip*** is not included due to the memory size for the upload. To test the code, the dataset has to be included and edit the dataset path in the code accordingly.

The corresponding testset predictions are also put in each of the folders.

Specifically, for pure-CNN and CNN-ResNet, they have their own training loss, loss curve, and model stucture.

The highest and finalized submission was from CNN-ResNet model.
